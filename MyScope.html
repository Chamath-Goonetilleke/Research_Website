          <p style="text-align: justify;">Traffic congestion presents a significant challenge in various countries,
            including Sri Lanka. The swift urbanization and increased use of motor vehicles in Sri Lanka have
            contributed to a rise in traffic jams, causing adverse effects on the environment, economy, and society.
            According to a report published by the World Bank, Colombo, the largest city in Sri Lanka, experiences an
            annual economic loss of approximately US$2 billion due to traffic congestion [1].</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptive traffic control systems collect traffic information at intersections
            using various sensing technologies. These include video cameras, LiDAR, radar, and inductive loops. [5]
            These sensors enable getting data about current traffic information. Adaptive traffic control systems
            utilize fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning to optimize traffic flow and reduce
            congestion.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">New techniques like YOLO and Fast-RCNN are being used to detect emergency
            vehicles in real time. These methods use deep learning and image processing to identify vehicles and siren
            lights accurately. Also, models like 1D CNN and LSTM are being developed to detect critical siren sounds.
            While there are limitations to these technologies, they are helping to create a more reliable system for
            detecting emergency vehicles and making the roads safer.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The accident severity detection component is based on the YOLOv8 (You Look
            Only Once Version 8) architecture, a deep learning model designed for image recognition and classification
            tasks. YOLOv8 is based on cutting-edge advances in deep learning and computer vision, providing excellent
            speed and accuracy. In the context of accident severity detection, this model can automatically extract
            meaningful features from accident images to predict severity levels.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">This research uses image subtraction technology to analyze sequential video
            frames to identify traffic offenses. This technique isolates moving objects, and potential violations are
            shown. Additionally, the study uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to identify motorcyclists who are not wearing
            helmets instantly. By accurately identifying situations where riders violate helmet laws, YOLO's
            sophisticated object detection abilities enhance road safety measures.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Traffic congestion has been a growing problem affecting various industries worldwide for many years.
              Because most of Sri Lanka's traffic lights are pre-timed, the times for green and red are static, which
              causes congestion on most roads. Here a novel traffic algorithm will be used to optimize the traffic. By
              utilizing real-time data from vehicle detection and tracking, the algorithm determines optimal traffic
              signal timings, prioritizing the movement of vehicles and minimizing traffic congestion.</p>

                  emergency vehicles, including ambulances, police vehicles, and firetrucks, within an intersection's
                  traffic light system. The system's procedure involves identifying an emergency vehicle and verifying
                  the presence of an emergency situation within that vehicle by inspecting both the siren lights and
                  siren sound. If either the siren lights or siren sound is activated, the system deduces the existence
                  of an emergency. In the event of an emergency vehicle with a confirmed emergency situation, the system
                  proceeds to halt traffic in other lanes and facilitate the unobstructed passage of the emergency
